House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

I wnated Ned to save his daughters and bring them back to Winterfell to prepare for winter. He should have had an honorrable death after teaching his daughters and sons all that they needed to know. Rise of the Starks!

He died due to a wicked betrayal, but his family was ready to take up where he left off, protecting the world for the real threat up North. Death to the White Walkers!
